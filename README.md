This project is a ready-to-go-production consumer level GNSS receiver with all source code ready to view including hardware model,
synthesizable RTL of the baseband hardware and full functional firmware from baseband control to position calculation.
It has the capability to receive L1 band signals (including GPS/QZSS L1C/A, GPS/QZSS L1C, Galileo E1, BDS B1C and SBAS)
